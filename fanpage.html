                <p>
                    Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved early popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, techno, rock and synth-pop.[1] The duo garnered further acclaim and commercial success and are now regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music history.[2]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daft Punk formed after Bangalter and de Homem-Christo's former indie rock band, Darlin', disbanded. Their debut studio album, Homework, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles "Around the World" and "Da Funk". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities; they made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records.

                    Daft Punk's second album, Discovery (2001), earned acclaim and further success, with the hit singles "One More Time", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". It became the basis for an animated film, Interstella 5555, supervised by the Japanese artist Leiji Matsumoto. Daft Punk's third album, Human After All (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk directed an avant-garde science-fiction film, Electroma, released in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album; the tour is credited for broadening the appeal of dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed the score for the 2010 film Tron: Legacy.

                <p>
                    In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records and released their fourth and final album, Random Access Memories, to acclaim; the lead single, "Get Lucky", reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for "Get Lucky". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Starboy", a collaboration with the Weeknd. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked them the 12th greatest musical duo of all time; the same publication has included two of their albums on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They announced their split in 2021.

            <h2>Some Reasons Why Daft Punk Are My Favourite Robots </h2>
            <center>
                <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/10IbZpJN1k9D7q/giphy.gif?cid=6c09b952j8vrm3941n6xl2391tqkjs2fch9r29gcwz9y95v5&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" width="50%">

            <ul>
                <li>I am obsessed with their music, as well as their other projects. They are true artists, and paved the way for many electronic / house artists today!. </li>
                <li>I love robots. They are robots and they make songs about robots, and about being robots.</li>
                <li>Even before they were robots, when they were doing Homework, they were still funky and boppy. Around The World and Da Funk are classic bops.</li>
                <li>Discovery is my go-to road trip / travel album.</li>
                <li>Discovery is legit one of the best albums of all time.</li>
                <li>They made an entire animated film of all the songs in Discovery (see <a href="#interstella">Interstella 5555</a>) which has a full storyline and deeper meanings and themes about the predatory nature of the entertainment industry, all of which still maintains particular relevancy to the themes of the album itself. All while having an absolute bop of an album as a soundtrack. They manage to make the film and its storyline emotional and immersive <strong>without any verbal dialogue</strong>, only the music. They let the music itself shine through and give the scenes further meaning.</li>
                <li>Daft Punk has an interesting connection to Glasgow, where I used to live. The original vinyl version of Da Funk was released by Soma Records, which is a Glaswegian company. They helped Daft Punk get their start outside of France! Also, one of their earliest shows before they got big was in Glasgow at the Renfrew Ferry on the River Clyde in 1995, and I heard that it totally rocked! Supposedly people who were there thought that the gig was such a banger the ferry would sink!</li>
                <li>Human After All is criminally underrated. Who hasn't heard of / doesn't love Robot Rock, or Technologic, or Television Rules The Nation?! For some reason Emotion always gets me. They bring so much emotion to the role of being robot-humans. But yeah this entire album is my go-to when I am building things, especially Technologic when I am troubleshooting something - it's a great motivator!</li>
                <li>Instant Crush with Julian Casablancas is one of the most perfect songs ever created. </li>
                <li>Tron:Legacy is one of my favourite movies of all times, especially with its themes relevant to the open source movement, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. Over a decade later, it still feels like a soundtrack from the future rather than one from 2010.</li>
                <li>I first heard One More Time when I was maybe around 9 years old at dance camp, and have been obsessed with that song ever since. It is the song I wake up to every morning.</li>
                <li>Touch. The song is trippy and strange at times, and I love it. The emotion, all of the different pieces that all come together, the UFO sounds, the sounds of heaven, listening to the song is an entire adventure. Also I feel like it took on further meaning during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
                <li>Their live albums from their performances are also amazing. Sometimes when I am studying, I turn on Alive 2007 and pretend that I am at a rave.</li>
                <li>Two words. Veridis Quo. Every time it comes on when I am running, I feel like I'm in a state of bliss and flow.</li>
                <li>Daft Punk are the kings of sampling. They don't just rip off half of somebody's existing song. The way they can transform even the smallest pieces into something incredible is amazing, it's real art. It's always interesting to hear the originals of the songs they sampled, and compare to see how much it was changed.</li>
                <li>Look at them, they're just hella cool!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'd write more, but it's like 2:30 AM here and I really need to sleep!</p>
